# Shady Meadows B&B Automated Testing

The project covers automated testing for the Shady Meadows B&B website using Playwright

## Getting Started

### Installation of Playwright

* It is recommended to use Playwright with VS Code
* In order to setup Playwright with VS Code please follow the instructions on (this page)[https://playwright.dev/docs/getting-started-vscode]

### Executing program

* In VS Code there is an existing method for running tests
* On the left-hand toolbar there is a "testing" icon which resembles a conical flask
* Navigate here and there will be a "Test Explorer" menu which will allow you to test all/any tests with the click of a button
* Press the "Play" icon to run tests, and the icon with a bug to run in debug mode
* Test results will be presented in a terminal window at the bottom of the application
* There are options in the left-hand menu for Playwright, to run tests in various ways, the most interesting of these is the "Show browser" option
* This will allow a user to verify that expected actions are taking place during a test run, useful for those writing their own tests
